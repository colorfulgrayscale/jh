LEED Once Building A Sustainable Urban Umbrella for the 21st Century Leading by Example Country House Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Making Elegant Space of an Uninhabitable Line Designing for the Delicate Sketches and Project, Italy and China Design Build- Outdoor Classroom Indescribable Places Giving back to a Deserving Community.Studio Work Fayetteville High School V. P. A. The Big Picture This addition to the neighboring Fayetteville High School rethinks traditional ideas of learning spaces and creates a model relevant to the 21st century. The Space Frame structure and skin combination dons the boundaries of a varied and vibrant high school sub-culture without the restriction of exterior walls. Restrictions translate negatively into studentsÕ attitudes towards life and especially the arts. The dynamic play of light and shadow that the umbrella casts on the interior sets the tone for an exciting exploration of the arts. The entire building is a stage for studentsÕ performances and artwork. . janivahenry.com The exploration of pattern, light and shadow for the surfaces/skin, led us to realize the potential for structural ability within the skin itself. . Library Auditorium Gallery Administration Bookstore Dining Classrooms Circulation Green Spaces Fayetteville High School V. P. A. The Program The dilemma of creating an urban, community-oriented environment that addresses concerns for studentsÕ security was resolved sectionally. Public spaces such as the library, gallery, administration and the grand entry amphitheater are located at ground level, while classrooms perch as upper levels. Each building under the umbrella is conceived separately. They are however united by the Space Frame overhead. The frame pierces through the library to create cozy reading spaces and forms balconies for outdoor classroom activities such as spray painting..Studio Work janivahenry.com This project creates spaces that encourage a strong sense of community. The street, which extends into the suburban neighborhood is the stage for the grand entry amphitheater, which reaches out in invitation to the community and the neighbor.ing high school. Both pedestrians and vehicles share the clearly demarcated Green street. The Space frame stretches across the street to embrace passersby. Strategic placement of a skating rink between non-recreational program, the overlapping of paths of movement and the various scales and focuses of study spaces encourage community among the students. ..Studio Work Fayetteville High School V.

The program, sequence of motion and the bisque, each respect the simple form of two curved walls imposed on the site. The landscape has been carved out to shade the sunken courtyard; the trees attain and continue the curved form of the wall. Locked into the woods, both the owner and guest have access to a shady retreat, countryside vistas, private and shared spaces. . The Country House is conceived of as poured-in-place concrete and glass. Local timbers cleared from the site would furnish the interior, while stone mined from the area would be mortared together to construct the three towering Þre places. The main entrance along with the kitchen and indoor dining spaces are located centrally. From this zone the owner . Studio Work The Experience Country House Studio Work Design Build- Outdoor Classroom The Big Picture This Elementary School Outdoor N Classroom is not simply a place that contains learning activities but is itself an instrument of learning. The architecture, the butterfly and vegetable garden on the north end and future solar and electrical installations in the pavilion are the preconceived instructors. . Another prime function of the classroom is the hosting of community activities. The classroom is not only accessible from the school on the south, but also from a public street on the north. The project is characterized by a sequence of spaces that increase in scale, suggest different student activities and have visual connections to each other for large gatherings. The spaces, defined by Mexican river rock and a continuous folding Redwood surface, are all wrapped by a continuous Board-form concrete wall. A pavilion dons the primary zone and provides shade and repose in the summer. ..Studio Work Design Build- Outdoor Classroom Getting The Details Right Determining Member Lengths Northeast Support System Southeast Support System East Side Solar Panel Support System Detail West Side Solar Panel Support System Detail Northwest Support System Southwest Support System 8 janivahenry.com Studio Work Indoor Environmental Air Quality LEED Office Building The most visible feature of the building is the large swooping roof. In addition to acting as a visible reminder of sustainable practices and other functions, it uses Bernoulli's principle to draw warm air out from the Natural Ventilation Cool Day interior. . A doubled skin/screen reduces the impact of extreme temperatures and allows hot air to escape before it even reaches the exterior walls. The screen and all windows are operable to reduce energy usage and increase ventilation, daylight and views. These are also optimized by reducing the height of interior walls. The cooling and heating systems are designed for optimal efficiency and are controlled by zones of usage via a raised floor system. . Natural Ventilation All paints, coatings, sealants and carpets are Hot Day low VOC materials. .

Items such as breast milk pumped by the mother are stored in the infant's space. The code-required amount of clear space is provided around the infantÕs incubator. . Mandatory Hand washing stations are provided at the entrance. . Function-appropriate floor surfaces define zones of use. Single Family Room Convertibility In 2009, most NICUs (including Phoebe Putney's) still utilized an Open Bay arrangement. In the Open Bay there are no physical barriers between the medical sta. and the infants. In order to ease the sta.Õs transition to the research-proven SFR, and to allay their apprehension, we proposed an SFR that is really a hybrid between a true SFR and the Open Bay. . Studio Work Flexibility Shared private porch for parents facilitate a sense of community. Neonatal Intensive Care Unit A small desk and chair allow parents to track their infantÕs NICU (option1) Rooms with Bathrooms Rooms without Bathrooms When the sta. becomes comfortable with the switch, or when the market or codes demand it, the hospital's transition to the true SFR would only require the addition of a single partition per room. . Another layer of Flexibility . Though the SFR is proven most effective for NICUs, it is limited by Phoebe PutneyÕs demographics. This hospital serves a poor community that includes numerous single mothers who have had multiple births prior and hold several jobs. These mothers find it difficult to spend long periods of time with the hospitalized infant. . In the interest of reducing unnecessary construction expenditure and meeting the demographicÕs needs while encouraging longer stays, we provided two NICU options. Each has 3 SFR variations. All rooms contain at least a sitting/sleeping area. In addition, some feature a shared porch and/or a shared bathroom. NICU option 2 can be seen on page 23. As opposed to option 2, option 1 gives porches preference over bathrooms..Studio Work Light, Sound and Views Neonatal Intensive Care Unit NICU Porch Extruded Detail NICU research shows that views to the outdoors significantly reduce parental stress. This in turn increases their ability to relate pleasantly, and with a more positive outlook, to the ailing infant and the sta.. All porches in both NICU options feature adjustable sun-screens. Unlike the soft interior furnishings the porchÕs decor encourages a more vibrant atmosphere. . Materials. . Direct sunlight should not come into contact with the infant. To contain light from the exterior window at the parentÕs room, that window has light transmittance of 60%, pixel shading on the facade and blinds inside. Acoustic treatment is specified for all windows, both inside and out. . Footsteps, sta. and family voices and the rolling of heavy equipment are some of the sounds that permeate a NICU. In order to protect resting infants, all floors received acoustic treatment. While the parent space floor surface was covered in a warm wood finish, the infant space was surfaced with playful interlocking rubber tiles. Medical space flooring is a similar anti-slip and impact resistant tile. All doors have a reflectance of less than 40% and are low in VOCs. All paints and sealants used throughout the NICU are also low in VOCs. . janivahenry.com Materials continued . Infant and medical spaces must be especially sterile. For this reason, smooth, uncovered, molded fiberglass, acoustic panels are used on the their walls. In contrast, acoustic panels covered with colored fabric are used to enliven and recreate a sense of home in the family spaces. Any sound and light that escapes from the extensive program surrounding the infants is absorbed by the hospital grade acoustic curtain that can be pulled to surround the incubator. A dark color is chosen to simulate the womb. Circulation. All SFRs are arranged around two large loops for easy way-finding. Corridors for sta.-only in which family may become disoriented are o. the loops and are barred by doors. Service elevators are placed at the entrance and in the core of the NICU, but public elevators are placed at the entrance only. Service and Support Service and support spaces are spread along the center of the NICU for easy access to a single item such as clean linen or machinery, from several locations. . A- Reception Area B- Discharge Nurse Once C- Exit Rooms D- Grieving Room E- Nurses Break Room F- Conference Room G- X-Ray Room The depth and width of the NICU do not permit the permeation of natural light. Since natural light is vital for the wellbeing and positive demeanor of stressed NICU practitioners, skylights are located in all the hallways where possible. Nurses especially benefit since their work stations extend into the halls. .
