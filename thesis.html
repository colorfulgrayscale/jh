			About SCI-Arc 
			Eric Owen Moss Hernan Diaz Alonso Director Graduate Programs Chair 
			Hsinming Fung John Enright Director of Academic A.airs Undergraduate Program Chair 
			The Southern California Institute of Architecture is dedicated to educating architects to imagine and shape the future. It is an independent, accredited institution o.ering undergraduate, 
			graduate, and postgraduate programs in architecture. In 2012 Graduate Architecture ranked SCI-Arc as #1 school of architecture and design in North America and around the world. 
			SCI-Arc’s faculty is composed of approximately 80 esteemed architects, theorists, writers, and artists renowned for confronting conventional architecture and education. Studio interac.tion is open and intensive. Students are rigorously challenged to re-examine assumptions, and to create, explore, and provoke the boundaries of architecture. Through public lectures, panel discussions, events, and gallery exhibitions, SCI-Arc embraces its connection to the community, and establishes an intimate relationship to both Los Angeles and its 500 students, many of whom choose to study here from countries worldwide. Attracting local and international students, faculty, and members of the interested public 
			inside and outside of architecture, SCI-Arc is at once a school and a forum for cultural discourse. 
			Located in an open space building that runs a quarter-mile long and stands over 30 feet high, SCI-Arc’s studios are spacious and bright. Originally built in 1907, the Santa Fe Freight Depot was eventually phased from use, and the building remained vacant through the 1990s. Covered in years layered by gra.ti artists, it wore the beginnings of an emerging Arts District, which would gradually infuse and renew the eastside of downtown Los Angeles. Sensing the strength of its pulse, SCI-Arc made it home in 2000. Today SCI-Arc is a lively and integral part of a historic and future-tense cultural center, surrounded by a diversity of residential options, urban infrastructure, and attractions. 
			About the Future Initiatives Program 
			David Bergman Peter Zellner Coordinator Coordinator 
			SCI-Arc Future Initiatives (SCIFI) is a one-year post-professional degree program leading to a Master of Design Research (M.DesR) in City Design, Planning, and Policy. Open to applicants with a professional degree in architecture or a bachelor’s degree or equivalent in any ﬁeld, the program requires attendance in the fall, spring, and summer terms. 
			SCIFI is focused on promoting innovation within design, policy, and planning in response to the economic, social, and environmental futures of global cities and regions. Future Initiatives is dedicated to supporting investigations into the impacts of urban and planning policy, transnational ﬁnancial markets, real estate speculation, and socio-economic globalization on the evolution of local urban fabrics. 
			SCIFI provides an integrated curricular focus on urban issues of scale. It is positioned as a local, national, and international center for the discussion of urban futures, contingent and variable planning strategies, and the development of advanced tools for urban research and design. Combining intensive research into the near-term future of cities with the use of current open-source design tools, SCIFI aims to invent new ways of modeling and testing variable urban design scenarios. 
			Working over three sequenced terms, SCIFI students develop solution-seeking urban research and urban design methods/techniques/processes grounded in the study of the history of the city, urban and regional development methods, city planning, and city management tools. Students integrate skills from across SCI-Arc’s programs including design technolo.gies, cultural studies, and hard technology applications. The SCIFI program is calibrated to incrementally build research skills, urban design expertise, and unique strategic thinking about cities and urban regions. By working from the unique, local, and particular, to the large, global, and generic, SCIFI students gain expertise in the subject of city-making through a comprehensive, nuanced understanding of a city’s history and design across scales. This careful sequencing of context and city-scale-based teaching, merged with intensive workshop-based learning, is intended to inculcate increased control over the subject of city formation, paralleled by a growing mastery of new urban research methodologies and 
			urban design tools. 
			SCIFI culminates in the production of thesis design or research projects. Working with core and visiting faculty, students generate deliverables that form the basis of a disserta.tion-quality research portfolio. The goal is for students to apply these experiences as part of an ongoing dialogue with the city formation process.

			SCI-Arc FUTURE INITIATIVES SUMMER STUDIO 2012 MARIBOR: Five Principles for a Di.erential Urbanism

			SCIFI FUTURE INITIATIVES 2011-2012:

			Project Overview 
			This project represents a comprehensive vision to manage growth and development in Maribor over the next 50 years. Our vision for Maribor is for it to be integrated fully into the European context, as a distinctly Slovenian city. The plan results in a framework for amenity driven development. 
			Project Description 
			This project creates a framework for growth and development in Maribor over the next 50 years. It's based on the vision that integrates the city into a broader European context while retaining a unique identity as a progressive and distinctly Slovenian city.  The plan leverages the city’s geography along with critical assets such as its University, the city's historic core, and the agricultural and mountainous landscapes to create an amenity driven growth strategy.  This is accomplished by addressing ﬁve critical issues related to urban 
			form: 
			1) Conserve land-- the plan seeks to direct growth in to compact and contiguous areas in order to prevent unmanaged sprawl.
			2) Maximize existing infrastructure-- the use of existing infrastructure can serve as a framework to support future development.
			3) Focus on the River-- at present Maribor’s urban waterfront is underdeveloped, this plan seeks to transform river adjacent land uses, which are now largely industrial and

			infrastructure, into community amenities. 

			4) 	Increase connectivity—presently Maribor is fragmented with areas produced in di.erent time periods disconnected from one another.  The plan seeks to improve mobility and urban form by increasing street connections. 
			5) 	Improve non-motorized transportation-- this plan envisions a city in which pedestrian and bicycle transportation can predominate. 
			These ﬁve principles, when fully implemented, can create a highly amenitized public realm that will produce a distinctive city.  By producing a high-quality community Maribor will be able to attract growth and development in a manner that reinforces its character and speciﬁc sense of place. 
			Studio Overview 
			Five Principles for a Di.erential Urbanism 
			1. 	
			Di.erential Urbanism permits both metric and non-metric geometries to produce both urban discontinuities and continuities. 

			2. 	
			Di.erential Urbanism develops both networks and ﬁelds to organize urban objects. 

			3. 	
			Di.erential Urbanism endorses both the autonomous object and the ambiguous composite ﬁgure 

			4. 	
			Di.erential Urbanism employs techniques for making continuities such as folding, smoothing, associating and gluing as well as techniques for making discontinuities such  as cutting, closing, butting, disassociating and unfolding. 

			5. 	
			Di.erential Urbanism must produce a traversal relationality between ﬁgure, ﬁeld, ground and network.


			 “There is nothing more pervasive in the dynamics of cities than geometry. All of the geometries known to mathematicians may be classiﬁed into two broad classes: metric and 
			non-metric.  Metric geometries, such as the familiar Euclidean geometry, are those in which concepts like length, area and volume are fundamental.  Non-metric geometries form a 
			more heterogeneous class, they include projective, di.erential, and topological geometries, but in all of them lengths, areas and volumes are not basic concepts.  The distinction between the two classes is sometimes drawn in terms of the types of transformations that leave geometric properties unchanged: while under transformations like translation, rotation and mirror-imaging all length, areas and volumes remain invariant, under topological transformations like stretching or folding they do not.  Hence, their lack of relevance in this non-metric branch of geometry.  On the other hand, properties like connectivity do remain unchanged under folding and stretching: if two points on a topological object could be joined by a path prior to these operations they can still be joined afterwards, provided no cutting or gluing has been performed.  Connectivity is, for this reason, a funda.mental non-metric property.” 
			                                                                           Manuel Delanda , “The Pervasive Role of Geometry and Matter in the Life of Cities” 
			This studio developed ﬁve conditions or objectives for what is deﬁned as a di.erential urbanism: an up-to-date approach to city design that produces a traversal relationality
			between urban ﬁgure, ﬁeld, ground and network.  Di.erential Urbanism initially set out some provisional deﬁnitions for re-modeling several historical understandings of the urban topos, in Greek a “common place” or in Latin locus,
			a place. From there the studio drew out a parallel, revised and annotated history for a theory of a contemporary topological urbanism, drawn from the perspective of new tools and 
			new architectural theories registered at the scale of the city. 
			Di.erential Urbanism examined several lineages in recent urban thinking in the contemporary context: Object Oriented Urbanism via Aldo Rossi, John Hejduk and OM Ungers; Field and Network Urbanism, via Stan Allen’s Field Conditions and Fumohiko Maki’s Collective Form; and Ambiguous Composite Figure Urbanism via Colin Rowe's Collage City. Di.erential Urbanism also has re-charted novel uses for  Rob Krier's morphological indices of urban spaces and types used here as spatial bridging devices between object and ﬁeld.  Lastly, Di.erential Urbanism scrutinizes several new and topical urban design approaches that blur ﬁgure-ﬁeld relations via mathematically and digitally driven techniques such as folding, 
			topological stranding and other parametric approaches to urbanism.
