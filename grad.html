                        LEED A.P. Bachelor of Architecture, University of Arkansas Master of Design Research in City Design, Planning and Policy, SCI-Arc For me, great architecture should encompass more than programmatic, aesthetic and structural concerns. Social responsibility and sustainability must become priorities for Architecture and Urban Design. A serious shift towards sustainable attitudes combined with a healthy respect for the environment should permeate the creation of architectural artifacts. The research, use and development of low-cost, sustainable materials would enable all classes of society to experience the dignity, beauty and comfort of good design. Architecture and Urban Design should not only affect quality of life, but also the cost of living. It should excite emotions, evoke positive social change and preserve the environment for future generations. . The great thing about being an architect is that you can walk into your dreams.

Figural City Rendering Ground Infrastructure janivahenry.com Project Movement optimizes the sectional and planar movement of people within a 5 mile radius in Los Angeles. Both public and private buildings are a tailored organization of figure-voids, designed to encourage and direct this movement, within a reconsidered infrastructural system. .

Larger buildings are utilized to create higher physical density and public open spaces.

Reduced connectivity and walkability, low physical and social density, and a lack of public green spaces, are issues addressed by Project Movement. Over 90% of LAÃ•s green spaces are private. Block reorganization in this scheme allows numerous private backyards to become shared green spaces. Greening all public transit corridors contributed to a 500% increase in total green space. . janivahenry.com.Studio Work Figural City A Closer Look Sectional and Planar Movement through Figure-Voids built ground area built ground area 50,473 sqft (50%) 55,000 sqft (47%) built ground area 49,473 sqft (28%) residential - 650,000 sqft doors 5 - 9 built ground area built ground area retail - 390,000 sqft 40,200 sqft (45%) 1,453 sqft (5%) doors 1 - 4 built ground area built ground area built ground area built ground area 30,400 sqft (35%) 60,500 sqft (40%) 65,300 sqft (35%) 60,300 sqft (20%) janivahenry.com.Figural City Studio Work Transit-Oriented Design Los Angeles Figure-ground Diagram Figural City Figure-ground Diagram Los Angeles Figure-ground Diagram 23% 77% Built Fabric Unbuilt Fabric Figural City Figure-ground Diagram 45% 55% Built Fabric Unbuilt Fabric Los Angeles Infrastructure Diagram Figural City Infrastructure Diagram Metro Stops Bus Stops Metro Routes Bus Routes Freeway Primary Streets Secondary Streets janivahenry.com An analysis of the freeways and sunlight penetration below them revealed that 95% of that area could be converted to sustainable green spaces. .

Ursula Frick and Thomas Grabner, also of the University of Innsbruck, deserve special mention for their work on the computational design aspect of this project. . Aggregated Figure is concerned with the housing unit and how it aggregates to constitute larger program. An architectural diagram, which is a progression through architectural types, beginning with the typical American single family unit, increases density by a factor of 4, as the types move along a street. . A currently untouched 1.5 square mile region is assigned property values based on site factors. A street pattern is then generated across the landscape based on slope. Aggregations from the architectural diagram are placed along these streets, by matching their densities with decided equivalent land values. This projectÃ•s architectural diagram is based on the transformation of a courtyard. . BirdÃ•s Eye View.Studio Work The Architectural Diagram Aggregated Figure The Architectural Diagram . This diagram begins with typical American suburban houses placed on both sides of the street. As it transforms past a courtyard house, density doubles, and the courtyard slowly unfolds vertically. It extends into a 'C' shape, whose arms bridge over the street, connecting aggre. gates. Density increases again, and the arms from both sides of the street fold together to accommodate larger program and occupy less ground area. The ability to use reduced ground area, not only allows the diagram to react to constrictive site conditions, but also provides aggregations for assignment to lots with higher value. When the transformation moves into the street, it assumes Hilberseimer's model BirdÃ•s Eye View of the integration of buildings and streets. .

The resulting site population is both dense and sparse, with the ability to contain a large range of program. Sections through multiple streets show how the aggregations combine across streets to form even larger masses. Innate to this courtyard scheme is the porosity necessary to make dense site population viable. The architectural diagram is designed so that the unit and subsequent aggregations remain legible. The project could therefore possibly be developed by numerous developers and architects. . Partial Site Model (Laser Cut Chipboard and 3D Print) 24 23   ..... Studio Work The Concept Coding Urbanism This project explores the variety that might be achieved when the natural physical properties of a site are allowed to push and pull the footprint of a typical grid-held of buildings into the ideal layout for that surfaceÃ•s topography. The idea that the grid should be maintained regardless of topography is challenged. The typical American suburban grid layout is low density, space is highly demarcated and personalized. The street is a completely separate entity from the buildings and buildings are disconnected. When affected by topography, these human constructs disappear. . The Same Grid Layout after being Altered by its Topography. . janivahenry.com A Grid Layout Projected unto a Varied Topography. Tension at the Property Line Coding Urbanism All project elements and the forces that will act upon them. After all of the elements and forces have been applied, computational design software Processing can begin extensive calculations that determine the shape of the city. . Modernism to its Absurd Extreme. This project has been described thus far in terms of the typical residential grid. However at this point, high density tower objects are assumed to be populated on-site to move the discussion to the urban scale. . Tension Lines cross ownership boundaries, pulling objects together. They deny low density suburbia and highly privatized space, by reducing empty backyard space. ..Studio Work janivahenry.com Low Density, Extreme Modernist Grid Layout, Projected onto a Varied Topography The natural physical properties of the site pushed and pulled the footprint of the typical grid-held of buildings into the ideal layout for that surfaceÃ•s topography. . Private property lines have been blurred as buildings merge to increase density and the amount of program that could be accommodated. . Connectivity is also dramatically increased when buildings and the streets that they interrupt become one. . The results seen here bring the concept of what the ideal city is into question. Is its form to be based on modernist socialist ideas that seek to effect change in a population, or should its form be dictated solely by physical site factors? .                     </div>
